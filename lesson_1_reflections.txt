How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Because I could see the difference marked.
Because the difference would be shown at a glance.
Because it will be marked in the right way.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because I could change to the latest working version of a program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

It is better to control de quantify of important information to be commited.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Becuase they work as a repository.
